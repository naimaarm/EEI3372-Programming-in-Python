Lab test 3
Write a program that lets user enter in a potentially unlimited series of price values. Ensure that the 
numbers entered are greater than 0. You cannot assume that the user will enter an integer or a float. If 
they input a negative number (or zero) you should continually prompt them to enter a valid number until 
they do so. When the user enters a price with a value of 0 you can stop collecting prices.

Then use their input to generate a summary report that includes the cost of all items purchased, the 
average cost of each item, highest priced item, and lowest priced item, number of items above & below 
the average. Below is a sample running of this program. Donâ€™t worry about formatting your numbers for 
this problem. 

Enter a price, 0 to end: apple That's 
not a number! 

Enter a price, 0 to end: -5 Prices must 
be positive! 

3

Enter a price, 0 to end: 10 

Enter a price, 0 to end: 20 

Enter a price, 0 to end: 30 

Enter a price, 0 to end: 40 

Enter a price, 0 to end: 50 

Enter a price, 0 to end: 0 

Total cost: 150.0 

Average cost: 30.0 

Highest price: 50.0 

Lowest price: 10.0 

of prices >= the average: 3 

of prices < the average: 2
